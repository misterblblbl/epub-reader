Can we remake a navigation a bit:

- all the navigational elements should be grouped all together at the bottom of the page
- the button to go any user-specified page should be near the page list (Page 1 of 52, go to [])
- the button for table of contents should also be at the bottom panel
- going to the next page should update the progress of the books
- the progress should be saved and displayed correctly at the main page with the books overview


I want to try out different colour schemes. Normally, readers have very neutral colours, but I'd like it to look a bit futuristic and flashy.

Can we try out different color schemes?
Please check out to a differerent branch called color-scheme-1
and change the color in the interface of our webapp to the following ones:

1. Neon Cyberpunk ‚ö°
Background: #0D0D1A (deep navy/black)
Primary text: #E0E0FF (light lavender-white)
Accent highlights: #A855F7 (bright purple)
Secondary accents: #06B6D4 (neon cyan), #FACC15 (neon yellow)
Feels like reading in a futuristic city at night.

2. Futuristic Dark Purple üåå
Background: #1E1B2E (dark indigo)
Primary text: #EDE9FE (lavender white)
Accent (links, selected words): #C084FC (light purple)
Secondary accent: #818CF8 (soft electric blue)

This is more elegant but still modern.

3. Flashy Gradient Glow ‚ú®
Gradient background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7E22CE, #EC4899, #3B82F6)
Text on top: #FFFFFF (white, slightly translucent)
Highlighted word: #FACC15 (gold) with glow effect
Good if you want a bold, ‚Äúholographic‚Äù feel.

4. Minimal but Flashy Purple üîÆ
Background: #2D1B4E (dark royal purple)
Primary text: #F3E8FF (very light lavender)
Accent: #9333EA (bright violet)
Highlight: #F43F5E (hot pink)

Keeps readability while still looking flashy.
